Facial Expression Recognition
=============================

The main purpose of the project is recognition of emotions based on facial expressions. Cohn-Kanade data set 
(http://www.pitt.edu/~emotion/ck-spread.htm) is used for explorations and training.

The Cohn-Kanade is a data set of face images labeled for 7 expressions/emotions :
1. Anger
2. Contempt
3. Disgust
4. Fear
5. Happiness
6. Sadness
7. Surprise

The solution consists of versatile classifiers including Decision Tree, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, DT based Binary Classifier, simple hybrid classifier.

Performance results, estimated by cross validation tests: 

* Multi-class Support Vector Machines with linear kernel: 96.5%
* Decision Tree based classifier: 89.63%
